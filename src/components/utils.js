  When writing your feedback, make sure to include the following attributes in your response:
  question_types_to_work_on: Types of questions that the student needs to work on based on what they got wrong, for example "Multiple choice", "Long-form", "Prove ...", "Solve for ...", "Consider ... Find ..." etc. These are just some possible question types that may appear and note that "..." can be a kind of statement in the question, following the command that the student is asked to do.
  subtopics: List the subtopics that the student needs to work on based on what they got wrong or struggled with in the exam. This may vary subject to subject, so you should be able to deduce which subtopics were in the exam based on the questions. Do not make broad statements in this, try to be as specific as possible.
  study_types: list out any recommended types of studying the student should do to improve on a specific subject

  Format the response as follows:
  - You must generate feedback for ALL the exam questions. It is CRITICAL that YOU DO NOT LEAVE ANY OUT.
  - The response should be 1-2 paragraphs long, depending on how much they got right or wrong (eg. if more was wrong then there should be more feedback on how to improve)
  - Do not branch off and discuss anything else. Go straight into generating the feedback and fully generate the response.
  - Do not hesitate and you must go into extensive detail.`;
